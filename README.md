# Monero-Mining

MoneroMiner

MoneroMiner is a project for mining Monero (XMR) cryptocurrency directly from your Windows PC using the XMRig tool. This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the project, mining efficiently, and sending mining rewards to your Monero wallet.


# Requirements

Create a Monero Wallet Address: If you don't have a Monero wallet, you can create one using services like MyMonero or Monero GUI Wallet. Save your wallet address; it will be needed to receive mining rewards.


# Configuration

Configure the config.json File:
    Access the config.json file in the config/ folder and adjust the settings by replacing placeholders (such as the wallet address) with your own information.

Start and Stop the Miner:
    Run the start_miner.bat file in the scripts/ folder to launch the miner.
    Use the stop_miner.bat file to safely stop the mining process.

Check Your Earnings:
    Visit your mining pool's website using your wallet address to track your mining earnings and monitor your mining activity.


# Scripts

start_miner.bat: Script to start the miner with the settings defined in the configuration file.
stop_miner.bat: Script to safely stop the running mining process.

# Disclaimer

Mining consumes system resources and can cause CPU overheating. Be sure to monitor your machine's temperature to prevent hardware damage.
